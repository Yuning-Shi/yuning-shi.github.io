<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a final-year master's student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Shibaura Institute of Technology, Japan. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the Division of Science at Tokyo Denki University, where I majored in Mathematical Informatics and Mathematics.

My research interests include computer vision, vision and language, machine learning, and deep learning, with a particular focus on their applications in autonomous driving, medical diagnostics, and life-support robots.

I speak, read, and write in Chinese, Japanese, and English. In terms of software skills, I can work with Python, PyTorch, MATLAB, and C/C++.
